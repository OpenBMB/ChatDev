- # LangChain
- Building applications with LLMs through composability
- Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.
- **Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.
- Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.
- ## Quick Install
- `pip install langchain`
- or
- `conda install langchain -c conda-forge`
- ## ü§î What is this?
- Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.
- This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
- **‚ùì Question Answering over specific documents**
- - Documentation
- - End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database
- **ü§ñ Agents**
- - Documentation
- - End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
- ## üìñ Documentation
- Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:
- - Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)
- - How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
- - Reference (full API docs)
- - Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
