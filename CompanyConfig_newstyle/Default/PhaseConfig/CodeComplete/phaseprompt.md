- According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 
- Task: "{task}".
- Modality: "{modality}".
- Programming Language: "{language}"
- Codes:
- "{codes}"
- Unimplemented File:
- "{unimplemented_file}"
- In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
- FILENAME
- ```LANGUAGE
- '''
- DOCSTRING
- '''
- CODE
- ```
- As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the {unimplemented_file} file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the {unimplemented_file} and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.
