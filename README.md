## üìñ Overview

MacNet is a specialized branch of [ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev) that focuses on supporting the research of agent scaling on arbitrary topologies using the Multi-Agent Collaboration Networks (MacNet) framework. MacNet utilizes directed acyclic graphs to facilitate effective task-oriented collaboration among agents through linguistic interactions. It supports cooperation across various topologies and among a large number of agents without exceeding context limits.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

To get started with MacNet, follow these steps:

  <p align="center">
    <img src='./misc/topo.png' width=550>
  </p>

1. **Generate Graph Structure:** Run `generate_graph.py` to generate the desired graph structure for your multi-agent collaboration network. You can customize the number of nodes and the topology of the graph. For example:

   ```
   python generate_graph.py --node_num 10 --topology tree 
   ```

2. **Configure MacNet:** The `generate_graph.py` will automatically update the graph config in the `config.yaml` file. You can check other parameters for deploying agents, including the LLM backend and prompt. Additionally, MacNet supports the **SRDD_Profile** dataset, which is a large-scale agent role prompt dataset. It allows you to randomly select system profile prompts for the deployed agents in the topology based on the software category. To use SRDD_Profile, specify the category using the `--type` parameter when running `run.py`.

  </p>

3. **Run MacNet:** Execute `run.py` to deploy agents on the specified graph topology and generate software based on the configuration in `config.yaml`. During this process, you can observe the complete graph structure, the code changes occurring from one node to another, and the corresponding agent suggestions. MacNet will run agents on the graph in the topological order. You can observe the code changes in each node transition and agent suggestions on each edge in real-time.


   ```
   python run.py --task "Develop a basic Gomoku game." --name "Gomoku" [--type <software_category>]
   ```

   - `--task`: Specifies the prompt or description of the software to be developed.
   - `--name`: Specifies the name of the software project.
   - `--type` (optional): Specifies the software category for selecting system profile prompts from the SRDD_Profile dataset.

  </p>
  

4. **Access Generated Software:** After the execution of `run.py`, the generated software can be found in the `WareHouse` directory. Each software project will have its own folder with a timestamp.

5. **View Logs:** The complete logs of the MacNet execution can be found in the `MacNetLog` directory. The logs are organized by timestamp and provide detailed information about the multi-agent collaboration process.

## üìñ Overview

Croto is a specialized branch of [ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev) that orchestrates multiple agent teams to jointly propose diverse task-oriented solutions and collaborate through strategic cross-team interactions at key phases. It enables teams to maintain their independence while leveraging collective insights for superior solution generation. The methods used in Croto‚Äîincluding greedy aggregation, hierarchy partitioning, and pruning strategy‚Äîare well integrated into MacNet codebase, specifically in `chatdev.waiting` and the aggregation function in `graph.py`.

```python
def aggregate(self, prompt: str, retry_limit: int, unit_num: int, layer_directory: str, graph_depth: int,
               store_dir: str) -> int:
     """Aggregate solutions from predecessors."""
     logging.info(f"Node {self.id} is aggregating with {len(self.pre_solutions)} solutions")

     with open("config.yaml", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
         cc_prompt = "\n\n".join(yaml.load(f.read(), Loader=yaml.FullLoader).get("Agent").get("cc_prompt"))
         cc_prompt = self.system_message + cc_prompt

     for file in self.pre_solutions:
         with open(layer_directory + "/solution_{}.txt".format(file), "w") as f:
             for key in self.pre_solutions[file].codebooks.keys():
                 f.write(str(key) + '\n\n' + self.pre_solutions[file].codebooks[key] + '\n\n')

     self.pool = Pool(len(self.pre_solutions), unit_num, layer_directory, self.model)
     for i in range(retry_limit):
         new_codes = self.pool.state_pool_add(layer_directory, cc_prompt, 6000000, prompt,
                                              Codes(),
                                              store_dir,
                                              temperature=1 - self.depth / graph_depth,
                                              )
         if new_codes is None:
             logging.info(f"Retry Aggregation at round {i}!")
         else:
             self.solution = new_codes
             logging.info(f"Node {self.id} has finished aggregation!")
             return 0
     print(f"ERROR: Node {self.id} has reached the retry limit!\n")
     return 1
```
