# Curriculum Guide: Grade 9 Music Class - AI and Composition

## Overview

This curriculum guide is designed to help students in grade 9 music class explore the intersection of music composition and artificial intelligence (AI). Over the course of four weeks, students will learn about the basics of music composition, AI-generated music, and how to create their own AI-assisted compositions.

## Goals and Objectives

* Students will understand the fundamental concepts of music composition, including melody, harmony, and rhythm.
* Students will learn about the basics of AI-generated music and its applications in the music industry.
* Students will create their own AI-assisted music compositions using software and tools.
* Students will develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills through the use of AI in music composition.

## Key Concepts and Skills

* Music composition basics: melody, harmony, rhythm, and form
* AI-generated music: algorithms, machine learning, and neural networks
* AI-assisted music composition: software and tools, such as Amper Music, AIVA, and Jukedeck
* Critical thinking and problem-solving skills: experimentation, iteration, and reflection

## Setup and Resources

* Computers or laptops with internet access
* Music composition software (e.g. Logic Pro, Ableton Live)
* AI-assisted music composition tools (e.g. Amper Music, AIVA, Jukedeck)
* Headphones or speakers
* Whiteboard and markers

## Assessment and Reflection

* Students will submit their AI-assisted music compositions for feedback and assessment.
* Students will reflect on their learning process through a journal or blog, documenting their challenges, successes, and insights.
* Class discussions and peer feedback will be used to assess students' understanding of key concepts and skills.

## Example Structure

### Week 1: Introduction to Music Composition

* Introduce the basics of music composition: melody, harmony, and rhythm.
* Have students create a simple melody using music composition software.
* Discuss the concept of AI-generated music and its applications in the music industry.

### Week 2: AI-Generated Music

* Introduce the basics of AI-generated music: algorithms, machine learning, and neural networks.
* Have students experiment with AI-assisted music composition tools (e.g. Amper Music, AIVA, Jukedeck).
* Discuss the potential benefits and limitations of AI-generated music.

### Week 3: AI-Assisted Music Composition

* Have students create their own AI-assisted music compositions using software and tools.
* Encourage experimentation and iteration, with feedback and guidance from the instructor.
* Discuss the role of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in AI-assisted music composition.

### Week 4: Reflection and Feedback

* Have students submit their AI-assisted music compositions for feedback and assessment.
* Have students reflect on their learning process through a journal or blog, documenting their challenges, successes, and insights.
* Class discussion and peer feedback will be used to assess students' understanding of key concepts and skills.

## PowerPoint Presentation

A PowerPoint presentation will be created to support the curriculum guide, including:

* Introduction to music composition and AI-generated music
* Key concepts and skills
* Setup and resources
* Assessment and reflection
* Example structure and activities for each week

The PowerPoint presentation will include images, diagrams, and examples to illustrate key concepts and skills, as well as links to online resources and tools.
