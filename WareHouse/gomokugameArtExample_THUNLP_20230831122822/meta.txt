Language:
Considering the task at hand, Python would be a suitable choice due to its simplicity and the availability of numerous libraries that can aid in the development of the game. Python's simplicity will allow for rapid development and testing, while its libraries can help with creating the game interface and handling game logic. Therefore, I propose Python as the programming language for this task.
