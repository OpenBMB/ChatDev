Overview

A fast and thorough lazy object proxy.

* Free software: BSD 2-Clause License

Note that this is based on `wrapt`_'s ObjectProxy with one big change: it calls a function the first time the proxy object is
used, while `wrapt.ObjectProxy` just forwards the method calls to the target object.

In other words, you use `lazy-object-proxy` when you only have the object way later and you use `wrapt.ObjectProxy` when you
want to override few methods (by subclassing) and forward everything else to the target object.

Example::

    import lazy_object_proxy

    def expensive_func():
        from time import sleep
        print('starting calculation')
        # just as example for a very slow computation
        sleep(2)
        print('finished calculation')
        # return the result of the calculation
        return 10

    obj = lazy_object_proxy.Proxy(expensive_func)
    # function is called only when object is actually used
    print(obj)  # now expensive_func is called

    print(obj)  # the result without calling the expensive_func

Installation
============

::

    pip install lazy-object-proxy

Acknowledgements
================

This project is based on some code from `wrapt`_ as you can see in the git history.

Changelog
=========

1.9.0 (2023-01-04)
------------------

* Added support for matrix multiplication operator (``@``).
* Should have all the wheels now (including the manylinux ones).
* Bumped minimum version requirements for setuptools and setuptools-scm.
* Switched the default pure python fallback implementation to the "simple" one (when you ``from lazy_object_proxy import Proxy``
  and the C extension is not available).
  Previously the "slots" implementation was used but as it turns out it is slower on Python 3.

1.8.0 (2022-10-26)
------------------

* Cleaned up use of cPickle. Contributed by Sandro Tosi in `#62 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/pull/62>`_.
* Cleaned up more dead Python 2 code.
* Added Python 3.11 wheels.
* Dropped support for Python 3.6.

1.7.1 (2021-12-15)
------------------

* Removed most of the Python 2 support code and fixed ``python_requires`` to require at least Python 3.6.

  Note that 1.7.0 has been yanked because it could not install on Python 2.7.
  Installing lazy-object-proxy on Python 2.7 should automatically fall back to the 1.6.0 release now.

1.7.0 (2021-12-15)
------------------

* Switched CI to GitHub Actions, this has a couple consequences:

  * Support for Python 2.7 is dropped. You can still install it there but it's not tested anymore and
    Python 2 specific handling will be removed at some point.
  * Linux wheels are now provided in `musllinux` and `manylinux2014` variants.

* Fixed ``__index__`` to fallback to ``int`` if the wrapped object doesn't have an ``__index__`` method.
  This prevents situations where code using a proxy would otherwise likely just call ``int`` had the object
  not have an ``__index__`` method.

1.6.0 (2021-03-22)
------------------

* Added support for async special methods (``__aiter__``, ``__anext__``,
  ``__await__``, ``__aenter__``, ``__aexit__``).
  These are used in the ``async for``, ``await` and ``async with`` statements.

  Note that ``__await__`` returns a wrapper that tries to emulate the crazy
  stuff going on in the ceval loop, so there will be a small performance overhead.
* Added the ``__resolved__`` property. You can use it to check if the factory has
  been called.

1.5.2 (2020-11-26)
------------------

* Added Python 3.9 wheels.
* Removed Python 2.7 Windows wheels
  (not supported on newest image with Python 3.9).

1.5.1 (2020-07-22)
------------------

* Added ARM64 wheels (manylinux2014).

1.5.0 (2020-06-05)
------------------

* Added support for ``__fspath__``.
* Dropped support for Python 3.4.

1.4.3 (2019-10-26)
------------------

* Added binary wheels for Python 3.8.
* Fixed license metadata.

1.4.2 (2019-08-22)
------------------

* Included a ``pyproject.toml`` to allow users install the sdist with old python/setuptools, as the
  setuptools-scm dep will be fetched by pip instead of setuptools.
  Fixes `#30 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/issues/30>`_.

1.4.1 (2019-05-10)
------------------

* Fixed wheels being built with ``-coverage`` cflags. No more issues about bogus ``cext.gcda`` files.
* Removed useless C file from wheels.
* Changed ``setup.py`` to use setuptools-scm.

1.4.0 (2019-05-05)
------------------

* Fixed ``__mod__`` for the slots backend. Contributed by Ran Benita in
  `#28 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/pull/28>`_.
* Dropped support for Python 2.6 and 3.3. Contributed by "hugovk" in
  `#24 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/pull/24>`_.

1.3.1 (2017-05-05)
------------------

* Fix broken release (``sdist`` had a broken ``MANIFEST.in``).

1.3.0 (2017-05-02)
------------------

* Speed up arithmetic operations involving ``cext.Proxy`` subclasses.

1.2.2 (2016-04-14)
------------------

* Added `manylinux <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/>`_ wheels.
* Minor cleanup in readme.

1.2.1 (2015-08-18)
------------------

* Fix a memory leak (the wrapped object would get bogus references). Contributed by Astrum Kuo in
  `#10 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/pull/10>`_.

1.2.0 (2015-07-06)
------------------

* Don't instantiate the object when __repr__ is called. This aids with debugging (allows one to see exactly in
  what state the proxy is).

1.1.0 (2015-07-05)
------------------

* Added support for pickling. The pickled value is going to be the wrapped object *without* any Proxy container.
* Fixed a memory management issue in the C extension (reference cycles weren't garbage collected due to improper
  handling in the C extension). Contributed by Alvin Chow in
  `#8 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/pull/8>`_.

1.0.2 (2015-04-11)
-----------------------------------------

* First release on PyPI.
