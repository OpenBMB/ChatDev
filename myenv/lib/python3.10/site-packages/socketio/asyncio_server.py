class AsyncServer(server.Server):
    """A Socket.IO server for asyncio.

    This class implements a fully compliant Socket.IO web server with support
    for websocket and long-polling transports, compatible with the asyncio
    framework.

    :param client_manager: The client manager instance that will manage the
                           client list. When this is omitted, the client list
                           is stored in an in-memory structure, so the use of
                           multiple connected servers is not possible.
    :param logger: To enable logging set to ``True`` or pass a logger object to
                   use. To disable logging set to ``False``. Note that fatal
                   errors are logged even when ``logger`` is ``False``.
    :param json: An alternative json module to use for encoding and decoding
                 packets. Custom json modules must have ``dumps`` and ``loads``
                 functions that are compatible with the standard library
                 versions.
    :param async_handlers: If set to ``True``, event handlers for a client are
                           executed in separate threads. To run handlers for a
                           client synchronously, set to ``False``. The default
                           is ``True``.
    :param always_connect: When set to ``False``, new connections are
                           provisory until the connect handler returns
                           something other than ``False``, at which point they
                           are accepted. When set to ``True``, connections are
                           immediately accepted, and then if the connect
                           handler returns ``False`` a disconnect is issued.
                           Set to ``True`` if you need to emit events from the
                           connect handler and your client is confused when it
                           receives events before the connection acceptance.
                           In any other case use the default of ``False``.
    :param namespaces: a list of namespaces that are accepted, in addition to
                       any namespaces for which handlers have been defined. The
                       default is `['/']`, which always accepts connections to
                       the default namespace. Set to `'*'` to accept all
                       namespaces.
    :param kwargs: Connection parameters for the underlying Engine.IO server.

    The Engine.IO configuration supports the following settings:

    :param async_mode: The asynchronous model to use. See the Deployment
                       section in the documentation for a description of the
                       available options. Valid async modes are "aiohttp",
                       "sanic", "tornado" and "asgi". If this argument is not
                       given, "aiohttp" is tried first, followed by "sanic",
                       "tornado", and finally "asgi". The first async mode that
                       has all its dependencies installed is the one that is
                       chosen.
    :param ping_interval: The interval in seconds at which the server pings
                          the client. The default is 25 seconds. For advanced
                          control, a two element tuple can be given, where
                          the first number is the ping interval and the second
                          is a grace period added by the server.
    :param ping_timeout: The time in seconds that the client waits for the
                         server to respond before disconnecting. The default
                         is 5 seconds.
    :param max_http_buffer_size: The maximum size of a message when using the
                                 polling transport. The default is 1,000,000
                                 bytes.
    :param allow_upgrades: Whether to allow transport upgrades or not. The
                           default is ``True``.
    :param http_compression: Whether to compress packages when using the
                             polling transport. The default is ``True``.
    :param compression_threshold: Only compress messages when their byte size
                                  is greater than this value. The default is
                                  1024 bytes.
    :param cookie: If set to a string, it is the name of the HTTP cookie the
                   server sends back to the client containing the client
                   session id. If set to a dictionary, the ``'name'`` key
                   contains the cookie name and other keys define cookie
                   attributes, where the value of each attribute can be a
                   string, a callable with no arguments, or a boolean. If set
                   to ``None`` (the default), a cookie is not sent to the
                   client.
    :param cors_allowed_origins: Origin or list of origins that are allowed to
                                 connect to this server. Only the same origin
                                 is allowed by default. Set this argument to
                                 ``'*'`` to allow all origins, or to ``[]`` to
                                 disable CORS handling.
    :param cors_credentials: Whether credentials (cookies, authentication) are
                             allowed in requests to this server. The default is
                             ``True``.
    :param monitor_clients: If set to ``True``, a background task will ensure
                            inactive clients are closed. Set to ``False`` to
                            disable the monitoring task (not recommended). The
                            default is ``True``.
    :param engineio_logger: To enable Engine.IO logging set to ``True`` or pass
                            a logger object to use. To disable logging set to
                            ``False``. The default is ``False``. Note that
                            fatal errors are logged even when
                            ``engineio_logger`` is ``False``.

                      reserved and should not be used.
        :param data: The data to send to the client or clients. Data can be of
                     type ``str``, ``bytes``, ``list`` or ``dict``. To send

                         prevent a message from being sent to the sender.

                          argument is omitted the event is emitted to the

                         that will be passed to the function are those provided
                         by the client. Callback functions can only be used
                         when addressing an individual client.
        :param ignore_queue: Only used when a message queue is configured. If
                             set to ``True``, the event is emitted to the
                             clients directly, without going through the queue.
                             This is more efficient, but only works when a

        Note: this method is not designed to be used concurrently. If multiple
        tasks are emitting at the same time to the same client connection, then
        messages composed of multiple packets may end up being sent in an
        incorrect sequence. Use standard concurrency solutions (such as a Lock
        object) to prevent this situation.
