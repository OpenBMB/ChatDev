Features
--------

- Depended on by
  Google, Venmo, CERN, Baidu, Tencent,
  and teams across the world since 2009

- Familiar, Pythonic APIs
  that are carefully designed for
  safety, simplicity, flexibility, and ergonomics

- Lightweight, with no runtime dependencies
  outside Python's standard library

- Implemented in
  concise, well-factored, fully type-hinted Python code
  that is optimized for running efficiently
  as well as for long-term maintenance and stability
  (not to mention `joy <#learning-from-bidict>`__ :)

- Extensively `documented <https://bidict.readthedocs.io>`__

- 100% test coverage
  running continuously across all supported Python versions


Installation
------------

``pip install bidict``


Quick Start
-----------

.. code:: python

   >>> from bidict import bidict
   >>> element_by_symbol = bidict({'H': 'hydrogen'})
   >>> element_by_symbol['H']
   'hydrogen'
   >>> element_by_symbol.inverse['hydrogen']
   'H'


For more usage documentation,
head to the :doc:`intro` [#fn-intro]_
and proceed from there.

Release Notifications
---------------------

.. duplicated in CHANGELOG.rst:
   (would use `.. include::` but GitHub doesn't understand it)

Watch `bidict releases on GitHub <https://github.com/jab/bidict/releases>`__
to be notified when new versions of bidict are published.
Click the "Watch" dropdown, choose "Custom", and then choose "Releases".


Learning from bidict
--------------------

One of the best things about bidict
is that it touches a surprising number of
interesting Python corners,
especially given its small size and scope.

Check out :doc:`learning-from-bidict` [#fn-learning]_
if you're interested in learning more.


Contributing
------------

I have been bidict's sole maintainer
and `active contributor <https://github.com/jab/bidict/graphs/contributors>`__
since I started the project ~15 years ago.

Your help would be most welcome!
See the :doc:`contributors-guide` [#fn-contributing]_
for more information.


Sponsoring
----------

.. duplicated in CONTRIBUTING.rst
   (would use `.. include::` but GitHub doesn't understand it)

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-sponsor-ff69b4

   :alt: Sponsors on GitHub

Bidict is the product of thousands of hours of my unpaid work
over the ~15 years that I've been the sole maintainer.

If bidict has helped you or your company accomplish your work,
please `sponsor my work through GitHub <https://github.com/sponsors/jab>`__
and/or ask your company to do the same.

Choose a tier and GitHub handles everything else.
Your GitHub sponsorship will automatically go
on the same bill you already have set up with GitHub,
so after the one-click signup, there's nothing else to do.

See the following for rationale and examples of companies
supporting the open source projects they depend on
in this manner:
