## Example Output

When I complete the workflow, you'll get a comprehensive security report:

```
=== SECURE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW REPORT ===

Project: DeFi Staking Contract
Platform: Solidity 0.8.19
Workflow Date: March 15, 2024

---

## STEP 1: KNOWN SECURITY ISSUES

### Slither Security Scan

Command: slither . --exclude-dependencies
Status: ✓ CLEAN (after fixes)

**Issues Found & Resolved:**
✓ HIGH: Reentrancy in withdraw() - FIXED (added ReentrancyGuard)
✓ MEDIUM: Unprotected selfdestruct - FIXED (removed function)
✓ LOW: Missing zero-address checks - FIXED (added require statements)
✓ INFO: 5 optimization suggestions - DOCUMENTED

**Current Status:** All high/medium issues resolved. Ready for next steps.

---

## STEP 2: SPECIAL FEATURES

### Upgradeability Check

Pattern Detected: UUPS Proxy (ERC1967)

**slither-check-upgradeability Results:**
✓ Storage layout compatible
✓ No function collisions
✓ Initialize function protected
✓ _authorizeUpgrade restricted to owner
⚠ No timelock on upgrades

**Recommendation:** Add 48-hour timelock before Step 3 (Critical)

### ERC20 Conformance

**slither-check-erc Results:**
✓ All required functions present
✓ transfer/transferFrom return bool
✓ decimals returns uint8
✓ approve race condition mitigated (increaseAllowance/decreaseAllowance)
✓ No external calls in transfer functions

**Status:** FULLY COMPLIANT with ERC20 standard

## STEP 3: VISUAL SECURITY INSPECTION

### Inheritance Graph

File: inheritance-graph.png

**Analysis:**
```
StakingToken
├─ ERC20Upgradeable
│  ├─ IERC20
│  └─ Context
├─ OwnableUpgradeable
└─ UUPSUpgradeable
```

✓ Shallow hierarchy (depth: 3)
✓ No shadowing detected
✓ C3 linearization correct
✓ No diamond inheritance issues

### Function Summary

| Function           | Visibility | Modifiers          | Mutability  | Risk  |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------|-------------|-------|
| stake()            | external   | nonReentrant       | non-payable | Low   |
| withdraw()         | external   | nonReentrant       | non-payable | Low   |
| claimRewards()     | external   | nonReentrant       | non-payable | Low   |
| setRewardRate()    | external   | onlyOwner          | non-payable | Med   |
| pause()            | external   | onlyOwner          | non-payable | Med   |
| _authorizeUpgrade()| internal   | onlyOwner          | view        | High  |

✓ All privileged functions have access controls
✓ External functions have reentrancy protection
⚠ setRewardRate() allows owner to set arbitrary rate (no bounds)

**Recommendation:** Add min/max bounds to setRewardRate()

### Variables and Authorization

**State Variable Access:**

totalStaked (uint256)
├─ Written by: stake() [external, nonReentrant]
├─ Written by: withdraw() [external, nonReentrant]
└─ Read by: calculateRewards() [internal]

rewardRate (uint256)
├─ Written by: setRewardRate() [external, onlyOwner]
└─ Read by: calculateRewards() [internal]
⚠ No bounds checking - can be set to extreme values

userStakes (mapping)
├─ Written by: stake() [external, nonReentrant]
├─ Written by: withdraw() [external, nonReentrant]
└─ Protected by access controls ✓

**Critical Finding:** rewardRate modification needs validation

---

## STEP 4: SECURITY PROPERTIES DOCUMENTED

### Properties Defined

**State Machine Invariants:**
1. totalStaked == sum of all userStakes[user]
2. contract balance >= totalStaked + totalRewards
3. User cannot withdraw more than staked

**Access Control Properties:**
4. Only owner can modify rewardRate
5. Only owner can pause/unpause
6. Only owner can authorize upgrades

**Arithmetic Properties:**
7. calculateRewards() cannot overflow
8. Staking amount must be > 0
9. Reward calculation precision loss < 0.01%

### Testing Setup

**Echidna Configuration Created:**
File: echidna.yaml
```yaml
testMode: assertion
testLimit: 50000
deployer: "0x10000"
sender: ["0x10000", "0x20000", "0x30000"]
```

**Invariants Implemented:**
File: test/echidna/StakingInvariants.sol
```solidity
contract StakingInvariants {
    function echidna_total_staked_matches_sum() public returns (bool) {
        return staking.totalStaked() == calculateExpectedTotal();
    }

    function echidna_balance_sufficient() public returns (bool) {
        return address(staking).balance >= staking.totalStaked();
    }
}
```

**Fuzzing Results:**
✓ All 3 invariants hold after 50,000 runs
✓ No violations found
✓ Coverage: 94% of contract code

**Next Step:** Run Manticore for formal verification (optional, 2-3 days)

---

## STEP 5: MANUAL REVIEW AREAS

### Privacy Analysis

✓ No secrets stored on-chain
✓ All state variables appropriately public/internal
✓ No commit-reveal needed for current design
⚠ User staking amounts are publicly visible

**Note:** Public visibility of stakes is acceptable for this use case.

### Front-Running Risks

**Identified Risks:**
⚠ setRewardRate() can be front-run by users to claim before rate decrease

**Scenario:**
1. Owner submits tx to decrease rewardRate from 10% to 5%
2. Users see pending tx in mempool
3. Users front-run with claimRewards() at old 10% rate

**Mitigation:**
- Add timelock to rewardRate changes (48-hour delay)
- Implement gradual rate transitions

### Cryptography Review

✓ No custom cryptography used
✓ No randomness requirements
✓ No signature verification
N/A - Contract doesn't use cryptographic operations

### DeFi Interaction Risks

**External Dependencies:**
- None (self-contained staking contract)

✓ No oracle dependencies
✓ No flash loan risks (uses snapshots)
✓ No external protocol calls

**Assessment:** Low DeFi interaction risk

## ACTION PLAN

### Critical (Fix Before Deployment - Week 1)

1. ✅ **Add timelock to upgrades** [COMPLETED]
   - Deployed TimelockController
   - 48-hour delay configured
   - Owner transferred to timelock

2. ⚠ **Add bounds to setRewardRate()** [IN PROGRESS]
   - Add MIN_REWARD_RATE = 1%
   - Add MAX_REWARD_RATE = 50%
   - Estimated completion: 1 day

3. ⚠ **Add timelock to rewardRate changes** [PENDING]
   - Use same timelock as upgrades
   - Estimated effort: 2 days

### High Priority (Before Audit - Week 2)

4. **Document all security properties** [80% COMPLETE]
   - 9/12 properties documented
   - Need to document upgrade invariants
   - Estimated completion: 2 days

5. **Increase test coverage to 95%** [CURRENT: 89%]
   - Add pause state tests
   - Add edge case tests (zero amounts, etc.)
   - Estimated effort: 3 days

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

6. **Add Manticore formal verification**
   - Verify critical properties formally
   - Estimated effort: 1 week
   - Impact: High confidence
