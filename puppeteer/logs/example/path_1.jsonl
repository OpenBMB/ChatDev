This represents a gap in thought since the question requires understanding and applying principles related to advertising ethics and regulations.

            "step_data": "REASONING RESULT: The question aims to test understanding of ethical advertising practices as guided by regulatory bodies. The multiple choices provide various options related to recommended behaviors and prohibited actions in advertising. The objective of this task is to identify which answer aligns most closely with widely accepted principles of advertising ethics and regulations. To achieve this, it is essential to break down and evaluate the key components of the question and choices based on the logical alignment of terms like \"safe practices,\" \"distress,\" \"jealousy,\" \"fear,\" \"offense,\" and their corresponding severity.\n\n**PLANNING STEPS:**\n\n1. **Understand Regulatory Advertising Standards:**\n   - Analyze the general expectations from advertising regulatory bodies, such as avoiding harm, promoting safety, and refraining from causing unnecessary offense or emotional responses.\n\n2. **Break Down the Key Terms in the Question:**\n   - Identify the implications of each term in the question: \"safe practices,\" \"distress,\" \"jealousy,\" \"fear,\" and \"offense.\"\n   - Assess how these terms contribute to ethical advertising.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n   - Examine each choice systematically and determine whether it aligns with the principles of advertising standards.\n   - Eliminate options that deviate from these principles.\n\n4. **Identify the Correct Answer:**\n   - Select the choice that best fits the principles after careful analysis.\n\n5. **Finalize Conclusion:**\n   - Present the reasoning for the selected answer clearly and concisely.\n\nBy following these steps, it will be possible to determine the correct answer with a logical and well-supported explanation.",
