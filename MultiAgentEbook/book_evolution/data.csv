Recent worksfocus on optimizing the agent team oremploying self-reflection to iteratively solvecomplex tasks.Since these agents are allbased on the same LLM, only conductingself-evaluation or removing underperformingagents does not substantively enhance thecapability of the agents.We argue that acomprehensive evaluation and accumulatingexperience from evaluation feedback is aneffectiveapproachtoimprovingsystemperformance.In this paper, we proposeReusableExperienceAccumulationwith360◦ Assessment (360◦REA), a hierarchicalmulti-agent framework inspired by corporateorganizational practices.The frameworkemploys a novel 360◦ performance assessmentmethod for multi-perspective performanceevaluation with fine-grained assessment.

Specifically, for agent-environment interactions, we substitute repetitiveLLM inferences with learned policies; while forinter-agent interactions, we model the social rela-tionships between agents and compress auxiliarydialogue information. Extensive experiments onmultiple environments show the effectivenessand efficiency of our proposed framework. Also,we delve into the mechanisms of emergentbelievable behaviors lying in LLM agents,demonstrating that agents can only generatefinite behaviors in fixed environments, basedupon which, we understand ways to facilitateemergent interaction behaviors.Our code ispublicly available at:https://github.com/AffordableGenerativeAgents/Affordable-Generative-Agents.",Tencent Inc.

All patients, nurses, and doctors are autonomous agents powered bylarge language models (LLMs). Our central goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illnesswithin the simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the simulacrum cansimulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases and LLMs, doctor agents can keepaccumulating experience from both successful and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show thatthe treatment performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More interestingly,the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital is applicable to real-world medicarebenchmarks. After treating around ten thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years),the evolved doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 9",Tsinghua University

Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression. NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts. We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7\% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7\% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs. Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication.","Tsinghua University, Tencent, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"

Existing approaches employ a fixed set of agents to interactwith each other in a static architecture, which limits their generalizability to vari-ous tasks and requires strong human prior in designing these agents. In this work,we propose to construct a strategic team of agents communicating in a dynamicinteraction architecture based on the task query. Specifically, we build a frame-work named Dynamic LLM-Agent Network (DyLAN) for LLM-agent collabora-tion on complicated tasks like reasoning and code generation. DyLAN enablesagents to interact for multiple rounds in a dynamic architecture with inference-time agent selection and an early-stopping mechanism to improve performanceand efficiency. We further design an automatic agent team optimization algorithmbased on an unsupervised metric termed Agent Importance Score, enabling theselection of best agents based on the contribution each agent makes. Empirically,we demonstrate that DyLAN performs well in both reasoning and code generationtasks with reasonable computational cost.

A representativescenario is in software development, whereLLM agents demonstrate efficient collabora-tion, task division, and assurance of softwarequality, markedly reducing the need for man-ual involvement. However, these agents fre-quently perform a variety of tasks indepen-dently, without benefiting from past experi-ences, which leads to repeated mistakes andinefficient attempts in multi-step task execu-tion. To this end, we introduce Experiential Co-Learning, a novel LLM-agent learning frame-work in which instructor and assistant agentsgather shortcut-oriented experiences from theirhistorical trajectories and use these past expe-riences for future task execution. The exten-sive experiments demonstrate that the frame-work enables agents to tackle unseen software-developing tasks more effectively.

Recent re-search has shown that LLM agents can lever-age past experiences to reduce errors and en-hance efficiency. However, the static experi-ence paradigm, reliant on a fixed collection ofpast experiences acquired heuristically, lacksiterative refinement and thus hampers agents’adaptability. In this paper, we introduce the It-erative Experience Refinement framework, en-abling LLM agents to refine experiences itera-tively during task execution. We propose twofundamental patterns: the successive pattern,refining based on nearest experiences within atask batch, and the cumulative pattern, acquir-ing experiences across all previous task batches.Augmented with our heuristic experience elim-ination, the method prioritizes high-quality andfrequently-used experiences, effectively man-aging the experience space and enhancing effi-ciency.

We unify these approaches by describing LLM-based agents as computational graphs. The nodes implement functions to process multimodal data or query LLMs, and the edges describe the information flow between operations. Graphs can be recursively combined into larger composite graphs representing hierarchies of inter-agent collaboration (where edges connect operations of different agents). Our novel automatic graph optimizers (1) refine node-level LLM prompts (node optimization) and (2) improve agent orchestration by changing graph connectivity (edge optimization). Experiments demonstrate that our framework can be used to efficiently develop, integrate, and automatically improve various LLM agents.

However, achieving real-time interactions with humans at a low computational cost remains challenging. Here, we introduce Lyfe Agents. They combine low-cost with real-time responsiveness, all while remaining intelligent and goal-oriented. Key innovations include: (1) an option-action framework, reducing the cost of high-level decisions; (2) asynchronous self-monitoring for better self-consistency; and (3) a Summarize-and-Forget memory mechanism, prioritizing critical memory items at a low cost. We evaluate Lyfe Agents' self-motivation and sociability across several multi-agent scenarios in our custom LyfeGame 3D virtual environment platform. When equipped with our brain-inspired techniques, Lyfe Agents can exhibit human-like self-motivated social reasoning. For example, the agents can solve a crime (a murder mystery) through autonomous collaboration and information exchange. Meanwhile, our techniques enabled Lyfe Agents to operate at a computational cost 10-100 times lower than existing alternatives. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of autonomous generative agents to enrich human social experiences in virtual worlds.","Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Peking University, LyfeAL"
