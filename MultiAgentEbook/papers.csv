(Perhaps) Beyond Human Translation: Harnessing Multi-Agent Collaboration for Translating Ultra-Long Literary Texts,"Minghao Wu, Yulin Yuan, Gholamreza Haffari, Longyue Wang",2024.5.20,"Recent advancements in machine translation (MT) have significantly enhanced
translation quality across various domains. However, the translation of literary
texts remains a formidable challenge due to their complex language, figurative ex-

framework based on large language models (LLMs) for literary translation, im-
plemented as a company called TRANSAGENTS, which mirrors traditional trans-
lation publication process by leveraging the collective capabilities of multiple
agents, to address the intricate demands of translating literary works. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our system, we propose two innovative evaluation strategies:
Monolingual Human Preference (MHP) and Bilingual LLM Preference (BLP).
MHP assesses translations from the perspective of monolingual readers of the tar-
get language, while BLP uses advanced LLMs to compare translations directly
with the original texts. Empirical findings indicate that despite lower d-BLEU
scores, translations from TRANSAGENTS are preferred by both human evalua-

domain-specific knowledge. We also highlight the strengths and limitations of

Affordable Generative Agents,"Yangbin Yu, Qin Zhang, Junyou Li, Qiang Fu, Deheng Ye",2024.2.3,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs)
has significantly advanced the simulation of
believable interactive agents.
However, the
substantial cost on maintaining the prolonged
agent interactions poses challenge over the
deployment of believable LLM-based agents.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop Affordable
Generative Agents (AGA), a framework for
enabling the generation of believable and
low-cost interactions on both agent-environment
and inter-agents levels. Specifically, for agent-
environment interactions, we substitute repetitive
LLM inferences with learned policies; while for
inter-agent interactions, we model the social rela-

dialogue information. Extensive experiments on
multiple environments show the effectiveness
and efficiency of our proposed framework. Also,
we delve into the mechanisms of emergent
believable behaviors lying in LLM agents,
demonstrating that agents can only generate
finite behaviors in fixed environments, based
upon which, we understand ways to facilitate
emergent interaction behaviors.

AgentCF: Collaborative Learning with Autonomous Language Agents for Recommender Systems,"Junjie Zhang, Yupeng Hou, Ruobing Xie, Wenqi Sun, Julian McAuley, Wayne Xin Zhao, Leyu Lin, Ji-Rong Wen",2023.10.13,"Recently, there has been an emergence of employing LLM-powered
agents as believable human proxies, based on their remarkable
decision-making capability. However, existing studies mainly focus
on simulating human dialogue. Human non-verbal behaviors, such

hibiting user preferences and could enhance the modeling of users,
have not been deeply explored. The main reasons lie in the gap
between language modeling and behavior modeling, as well as the

To address this issue, we propose AgentCF for simulating user-

Apollo's Oracle: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning in Multi-Agent Debates,"Haotian Wang, Xiyuan Du, Weijiang Yu, Qianglong Chen, Kun Zhu, Zheng Chu, Lian Yan, Yi Guan",2023.12.8,"Multi-agent debate systems are designed to derive accurate and consistent conclusions through adversarial interactions among agents. However, these systems often encounter challenges due to cognitive constraints, manifesting as (1) agents' obstinate adherence to incorrect viewpoints and (2) their propensity to abandon correct viewpoints. These issues are primarily responsible for the ineffectiveness of such debates. Addressing the challenge of cognitive constraints, we introduce a novel framework, the Multi-Agent Debate with Retrieval Augmented (MADRA). MADRA incorporates retrieval of prior knowledge into the debate process, effectively breaking cognitive constraints and enhancing the agents' reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we have developed a self-selection module within this framework, enabling agents to autonomously select pertinent evidence, thereby minimizing the impact of irrelevant or noisy data. We have comprehensively tested and analyzed MADRA across six diverse datasets.

Are you in a Masquerade?

Researchers have begun exploring the implementation of LLMs as the driving core of social bots, enabling more efficient and user-friendly completion of tasks like profile completion, social behavior decision-making, and social content generation. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research on the behavioral characteristics of LLMs-driven social bots and their impact on social networks. We have curated data from Chirper, a Twitter-like social network populated by LLMs-driven social bots and embarked on an exploratory study. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs-driven social bots possess enhanced individual-level camouflage while exhibiting certain collective characteristics; (2) these bots have the ability to exert influence on online communities through toxic behaviors; (3) existing detection methods are applicable to the activity environment of LLMs-driven social bots but may be subject to certain limitations in effectiveness. Moreover, we have organized the data collected in our study into the Masquerade-23 dataset, which we have publicly released, thus addressing the data void in the subfield of LLMs-driven social bots behavior datasets.

ATM: Adversarial Tuning Multi-agent System Makes a Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generator,"Junda Zhu, Lingyong Yan, Haibo Shi, Dawei Yin, Lei Sha",2024.5.28,"Large language models (LLMs) are proven to
benefit a lot from retrieval-augmented genera-

RAG adopts information retrieval techniques
to inject external knowledge from semantic-
relevant documents as input contexts. How-
ever, due to today’s Internet being flooded with
numerous noisy and fabricating content, it is
inevitable that RAG systems are vulnerable
to these noises and prone to respond incor-

the retrieval-augmented GENERATOR with a
Adversarial Tuning Multi-agent system (ATM).
The ATM steers the GENERATOR to have a ro-
bust perspective of useful documents for ques-
tion answering with the help of an auxiliary
ATTACKER agent. The GENERATOR and the
ATTACKER are tuned adversarially for several
iterations. After rounds of multi-agent itera-

better discriminate useful documents amongst

Auto Arena of LLMs: Automating LLM Evaluations with Agent Peer-battles and Committee Discussions,"Ruochen Zhao, Wenxuan Zhang, Yew Ken Chia, Deli Zhao, Lidong Bing",2024.5.30,"As LLMs evolve on a daily basis, there is an urgent need for a trustworthy evaluation

require extensive manual efforts. To provide an automatic, robust, and trustworthy
evaluation framework, we innovatively propose the Auto-Arena of LLMs, which
automates the entire evaluation process with LLM agents. Firstly, an examiner
LLM devises queries. Then, a pair of candidate LLMs engage in a multi-round peer-
battle around the query, during which the LLM’s true performance gaps become
visible. Finally, a committee of LLM judges collectively discuss and determine the
winner, which alleviates bias and promotes fairness. In our extensive experiment

LLM agents really simulate human behaviors? In
this paper, we focus on one of the most critical
behaviors in human interactions, trust, and aim to
investigate whether or not LLM agents can sim-
ulate human trust behaviors. We first find that
LLM agents generally exhibit trust behaviors, re-

Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long-Context Tasks,"Yusen Zhang, Ruoxi Sun, Yanfei Chen, Tomas Pfister, Rui Zhang, Sercan Ö. Arik",2024.6.4,"Addressing the challenge of effectively processing long contexts has become a critical issue for Large Language Models (LLMs). Two common strategies have emerged: 1) reducing the input length, such as retrieving relevant chunks by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 2) expanding the context window limit of LLMs. However, both strategies have drawbacks: input reduction has no guarantee of covering the part with needed information, while window extension struggles with focusing on the pertinent information for solving the task. To mitigate these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel framework that harnesses multi-agent collaboration through natural language to enable information aggregation and context reasoning across various LLMs over long-context tasks. CoA consists of multiple worker agents who sequentially communicate to handle different segmented portions of the text, followed by a manager agent who synthesizes these contributions into a coherent final output. CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. We perform comprehensive evaluation of CoA on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion, demonstrating significant improvements by up to 10% over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02818,Organization,Computation and Language (cs.CL),chain_of_agents_large_20240604,"Penn State University, Google Cloud AI Research"

Two main difficulties are identified: 1) executing plans in an open-world environment (e.g., Minecraft) necessitates accurate and multi-step reasoning due to the long-term nature of tasks, and 2) as vanilla planners do not consider how easy the current agent can achieve a given sub-task when ordering parallel sub-goals within a complicated plan, the resulting plan could be inefficient or even infeasible. To this end, we propose ""Describe, Explain, Plan and Select"" (DEPS), an interactive planning approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs). DEPS facilitates better error correction on initial LLM-generated plan by integrating description of the plan execution process and providing self-explanation of feedback when encountering failures during the extended planning phases.

Examining Inter-Consistency of Large Language Models Collaboration: An In-depth Analysis via Debate,"Kai Xiong, Xiao Ding, Yixin Cao, Ting Liu, Bing Qin",2023.5.19,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in various applications,
but they still face various inconsistency issues.
Existing works primarily focus on the incon-
sistency issues within a single LLM, while we
complementarily explore the inter-consistency
among multiple LLMs for collaboration. To
examine whether LLMs can collaborate effec-
tively to achieve a consensus for a shared goal,
we focus on commonsense reasoning, and in-
troduce a formal debate framework (FORD)
to conduct a three-stage debate among LLMs
with real-world scenarios alignment: fair de-
bate, mismatched debate, and roundtable de-
bate. Through extensive experiments on var-
ious datasets, LLMs can effectively collabo-
rate to reach a consensus despite noticeable
inter-inconsistencies, but imbalances in their
abilities can lead to domination by superior
LLMs. Leveraging a more advanced LLM like
GPT-4 as an authoritative judge can boost col-
laboration performance. Our work contributes

Exploring Collaboration Mechanisms for LLM Agents: A Social Psychology View,"Jintian Zhang, Xin Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Ruibo Liu, Bryan Hooi, Shumin Deng",2023.10.3,"As Natural Language Processing (NLP) sys-

Can these NLP systems mirror human-esque
collaborative intelligence, in a multi-agent so-
ciety consisting of multiple large language mod-
els (LLMs)? This paper probes the collabora-
tion mechanisms among contemporary NLP
systems by melding practical experiments with
theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique
‘societies’ comprised of LLM agents, where
each agent is characterized by a specific ‘trait’
(easy-going or overconfident) and engages in
collaboration with a distinct ‘thinking pattern’
(debate or reflection).
Through evaluating
these multi-agent societies on three benchmark
datasets, we discern that certain collaborative
strategies not only outshine previous top-tier
approaches but also optimize efficiency (using
fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results fur-
ther illustrate that LLM agents manifest human-
like social behaviors, such as conformity and
consensus reaching, mirroring foundational so-
cial psychology theories. In conclusion, we
integrate insights from social psychology to
contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents,

Facilitating Multi-Role and Multi-Behavior Collaboration of Large Language Models for Online Job Seeking and Recruiting,"Hongda Sun, Hongzhan Lin, Haiyu Yan, Chen Zhu, Yang Song, Xin Gao, Shuo Shang, Rui Yan",2024.5.28,"The emergence of online recruitment services has revolutionized
the traditional landscape of job seeking and recruitment, neces-

modeling the latent semantics of resumes and job descriptions and
learning a matching function between them. Inspired by the pow-
erful role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs),
we propose to introduce a mock interview process between LLM-

To this end, we propose MockLLM, a novel applicable framework
that divides the person-job matching process into two modules:
mock interview generation and two-sided evaluation in handshake

in the capacity of representatives of human agents, appropriately expressing the
preferences of those individuals whom they stand for. First, we formalize the setting
of collective decision-making—as the episodic process of interaction between a
group of agents and a decision mechanism. On this basis, we then formalize the

Large Language Models are Diverse Role-Players for Summarization Evaluation,"Ning Wu, Ming Gong, Linjun Shou, Shining Liang, Daxin Jiang",2023.3.27,". Text summarization has a wide range of applications in many scenarios.
The evaluation of the quality of the generated text is a complex problem. A big
challenge to language evaluation is that there is a clear divergence between existing
metrics and human evaluation. A document summary’s quality can be assessed
by human annotators on various criteria, both objective ones like grammar and
correctness, and subjective ones like informativeness, succinctness, and appeal.
Most of the automatic evaluation methods like BLUE/ROUGE may be not able
to adequately capture the above dimensions. In this paper, we propose a new
evaluation framework based on LLMs, which provides a comprehensive evaluation
framework by comparing generated text and reference text from both objective and
subjective aspects. First, we propose to model objective and subjective dimensions
of generated text based on roleplayers prompting mechanism. Furthermore, we
introduce a context-based prompting mechanism that is able to generate dynamic
roleplayer profiles based on input context. Finally, we design a multi-roleplayer

Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM's Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game,"Qianqiao Xu, Zhiliang Tian, Hongyan Wu, Zhen Huang, Yiping Song, Feng Liu, Dongsheng Li",2024.4.3,"With the enhanced performance of large models on natural language processing
tasks, potential moral and ethical issues of large models arise. There exist ma-
licious attackers who induce large models to jailbreak and generate information
containing illegal, privacy-invasive information through techniques such as prompt
engineering. As a result, large models counter malicious attackers’ attacks using
techniques such as safety alignment. However, the strong defense mechanism
of the large model through rejection replies is easily identified by attackers and
used to strengthen attackers’ capabilities. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent
attacker-disguiser game approach to achieve a weak defense mechanism that allows
the large model to both safely reply to the attacker and hide the defense intent. First,
we construct a multi-agent framework to simulate attack and defense scenarios,
playing different roles to be responsible for attack, disguise, safety evaluation,
and disguise evaluation tasks. After that, we design attack and disguise game
algorithms to optimize the game strategies of the attacker and the disguiser and use
the curriculum learning process to strengthen the capabilities of the agents. The
experiments verify that the method in this paper is more effective in strengthening
the model’s ability to disguise the defense intent compared with other methods.
Moreover, our approach can adapt any black-box large model to assist the model in
defense and does not suffer from model version iterations.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02532,Organization,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),learn_to_disguise_avoid_20240403,"National University of Defense Technology, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, "
Leveraging Large Language Models for Collective Decision-Making,"Marios Papachristou, Longqi Yang, Chin-Chia Hsu",2023.11.3,"In various work contexts, such as meeting scheduling, collaborating, and project planning, collective decision-making is essential but often challenging due to diverse individual preferences, varying work focuses, and power dynamics among members. To address this, we propose a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate group decision-making by managing conversations and balancing preferences among individuals. Our system aims to extract individual preferences from conversations and suggest options that satisfy the preferences of the members. We specifically apply this system to corporate meeting scheduling. We create synthetic employee profiles and simulate conversations at scale, leveraging LLMs to evaluate the system performance as a novel approach to conducting a user study. Our results indicate efficient coordination with reduced interactions between the members and the LLM-based system. The system refines and improves its proposed options over time, ensuring that many of the members' individual preferences are satisfied in an equitable way. Finally, we conduct a survey study involving human participants to assess our system's ability to aggregate preferences and reasoning about them.

LLM-Driven Agents for Influencer Selection in Digital Advertising Campaigns,"Xiaoqing Zhang, Xiuying Chen, Yuhan Liu, Jianzhou Wang, Zhenxing Hu, Rui Yan",2024.3.22,"In the digital world, influencers are pivotal as opinion leaders, shap-
ing the views and choices of their influencees. Modern advertising
often follows this trend, where marketers choose appropriate in-
fluencers for product endorsements, based on thorough market
analysis. Previous studies on influencer selection have typically
relied on numerical representations of individual opinions and
interactions, a method that simplifies the intricacies of social dy-
namics. With the development of large language models (LLMs),
we now have the opportunity to capture the nuanced exchanges
of information within social networks. Hence, in this work, we
first introduce an Influencer Dynamics Simulator (IDS), helping
promoters identify and select the right influencers to market their
products, based on LLM simulation. Concretely, we first propose an
influencer-influencee engagement-based pre-selection module to
screen potential influencer candidates. Subsequently, a simulation is
constructed for these candidates and their influencees. Each user is
represented as an LLM-based agent, drawing from their interaction
history to deduce their profile and interests. The influencee agents
will predict their behavior in response to influencer advertising. Fi-
nally, we develop a ranking metric designed to pinpoint influencers
who are most likely to drive product purchases based on feedback

key idea is that an incorrect claim is likely to
result in inconsistency with other claims that
the model generates. To discover such incon-
sistencies, we facilitate a multi-turn interaction
between the LM that generated the claim and
another LM (acting as an examiner) which in-

Quantifying the Impact of Large Language Models on Collective Opinion Dynamics,"Chao Li, Xing Su, Haoying Han, Cong Xue, Chunmo Zheng, Chao Fan",2023.8.7,"The process of opinion expression and exchange is a critical component of democratic societies. As people interact with large language models (LLMs) in the opinion shaping process different from traditional media, the impacts of LLMs are increasingly recognized and being concerned. However, the knowledge about how LLMs affect the process of opinion expression and exchange of social opinion networks is very limited. Here, we create an opinion network dynamics model to encode the opinions of LLMs, cognitive acceptability and usage strategies of individuals, and simulate the impact of LLMs on opinion dynamics in a variety of scenarios. The outcomes of the simulations inform about effective demand-oriented opinion network interventions. The results from this study suggested that the output opinion of LLMs has a unique and positive effect on the collective opinion difference. The marginal effect of cognitive acceptability on collective opinion formation is nonlinear and shows a decreasing trend. When people partially rely on LLMs, the exchange process of opinion becomes more intense and the diversity of opinion becomes more favorable. In fact, there is 38.6% more opinion diversity when people all partially rely on LLMs, compared to prohibiting the use of LLMs entirely. The optimal diversity of opinion was found when the fractions of people who do not use, partially rely on, and fully rely on LLMs reached roughly 4:12:1. Our experiments also find that introducing extra agents with opposite/neutral/random opinions, we can effectively mitigate the impact of biased/toxic output from LLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights into opinion dynamics in the age of LLMs, highlighting the need for customized interventions tailored to specific scenarios to address the drawbacks of improper output and use of LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03313,Simulation,Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),quantifying_the_impact_of_20230807," Zhejiang University, Clemson University, "
ReConcile: Round-Table Conference Improves Reasoning via Consensus among Diverse LLMs,"Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Swarnadeep Saha, Mohit Bansal",2023.9.22,"Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with natural language reasoning tasks. Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose ReConcile, a multi-model multi-agent framework designed as a round table conference among diverse LLM agents. ReConcile enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt' that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly improves LLMs' reasoning -- both individually and as a team -- surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4% and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. ReConcile also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8% improvement on MATH.

science. It offers extensive applications such as state prediction, phenomena ex-
planation, and policy-making support, among others. In this work, we harness the
human-like capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in sensing, reasoning,
and behaving, and utilize these qualities to construct the S3 system (short for
Social network Simulation System). Adhering to the widely employed agent-based
simulation paradigm, we employ fine-tuning and prompt engineering techniques to
ensure that the agent’s behavior closely emulates that of a genuine human within
the social network. Specifically, we simulate three pivotal aspects: emotion, at-
titude, and interaction behaviors. By endowing the agent in the system with the
ability to perceive the informational environment and emulate human actions, we
observe the emergence of population-level phenomena, including the propagation
of information, attitudes, and emotions. We conduct an evaluation encompassing
two levels of simulation, employing real-world social network data. Encouragingly,
the results demonstrate promising accuracy. This work represents an initial step in
the realm of social network simulation empowered by LLM-based agents. We an-

Scalable Multi-Robot Collaboration with Large Language Models: Centralized or Decentralized Systems?,"Yongchao Chen, Jacob Arkin, Yang Zhang, Nicholas Roy, Chuchu Fan",2023.9.27,"— A flurry of recent work has demonstrated that
pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can be effective
task planners for a variety of single-robot tasks. The planning
performance of LLMs is significantly improved via prompting
techniques, such as in-context learning or re-prompting with
state feedback, placing new importance on the token budget
for the context window. An under-explored but natural next
direction is to investigate LLMs as multi-robot task planners.
However, long-horizon, heterogeneous multi-robot planning
introduces new challenges of coordination while also pushing
up against the limits of context window length. It is therefore
critical to find token-efficient LLM planning frameworks that
are also able to reason about the complexities of multi-robot
coordination. In this work, we compare the task success rate and
token efficiency of four multi-agent communication frameworks
(centralized, decentralized, and two hybrid) as applied to
four coordination-dependent multi-agent 2D task scenarios for
increasing numbers of agents. We find that a hybrid framework
achieves better task success rates across all four tasks and
scales better to more agents. We further demonstrate the hybrid
frameworks in 3D simulations where the vision-to-text problem
and dynamical errors are considered. ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15943,Organization,Robotics (cs.RO),scalable_multi-robot_collaboration_with_20230927,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. "

Self-Organized multi-Agent framework (SoA),

agent remains constant. We evaluate SoA on

Simulating Social Media Using Large Language Models to Evaluate Alternative News Feed Algorithms,"Petter Törnberg, Diliara Valeeva, Justus Uitermark, Christopher Bail",2023.10.5,". Social media is often criticized for amplifying
toxic discourse and discouraging constructive conversa-
tions. But designing social media platforms to promote
better conversations is inherently challenging. This paper
asks whether simulating social media through a combina-
tion of Large Language Models (LLM) and Agent-Based
Modeling can help researchers study how different news
feed algorithms shape the quality of online conversations.
We create realistic personas using data from the Ameri-
can National Election Study to populate simulated social
media platforms. Next, we prompt the agents to read
and share news articles — and like or comment upon
each other’s messages — within three platforms that use
different news feed algorithms. In the first platform, users
see the most liked and commented posts from users whom
they follow. In the second, they see posts from all users —
even those outside their own network. The third platform
employs a novel “bridging” algorithm that highlights posts
that are liked by people with opposing political views. We
find this bridging algorithm promotes more constructive,
non-toxic, conversation across political divides than the
other two models. Though further research is needed to
evaluate these findings, we argue that LLMs hold consid-
erable potential to improve simulation research on social
media and many other complex social settings.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05984,Simulation,Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),simulating_social_media_using_20231005,"University of Amsterdam, Duke University"
Social Simulacra: Creating Populated Prototypes for Social Computing Systems,"Joon Sung Park, Lindsay Popowski, Carrie J. Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Percy Liang, Michael S. Bernstein",2022.8.8,"Social computing prototypes probe the social behaviors that may
arise in an envisioned system design. This prototyping practice
is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people. Unfortu-
nately, many challenges do not arise until a system is populated
at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a social system
might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the de-
sign before the system falls prey to such challenges? We intro-
duce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that generates a
breadth of realistic social interactions that may emerge when a so-
cial computing system is populated. Social simulacra take as input
the designer’s description of a community’s design—goal, rules, and
member personas—and produce as output an instance of that design
with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social
behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors
that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and
that they enable exploration of “what if?” scenarios where commu-
nity members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra,
we contribute techniques for prompting a large language model
to generate thousands of distinct community members and their
social interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by
the observation that large language models’ training data already
includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social
media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are of-
ten unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual community
behavior and that social computing designers successfully refine
their social computing designs when using social simulacra.

"StrategyLLM: Large Language Models as Strategy Generators, Executors, Optimizers, and Evaluators for Problem Solving","Chang Gao, Haiyun Jiang, Deng Cai, Shuming Shi, Wai Lam",2023.11.15,"Most existing prompting methods suffer from the issues of generalizability and consistency, as they often rely on instance-specific solutions that may not be applicable to other instances and lack task-level consistency across the selected few-shot examples.

the model’s responses to user prompts accurately reflect human intentions and
adhere to societal values. The standard Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) framework primarily focuses on optimizing the performance of
large language models using pre-collected prompts. However, collecting prompts
that provide comprehensive coverage is both tedious and challenging, and often
fails to include scenarios that LLMs need to improve on the most. In this paper,
we investigate alignment through the lens of two-agent games, involving iterative
interactions between an adversarial and a defensive agent. The adversarial agent’s
task at each step is to generate prompts that expose the weakness of the defensive
agent. In return, the defensive agent seeks to improve its responses to these newly

We theoretically demonstrate that this iterative reinforcement learning optimization
converges to a Nash Equilibrium for the game induced by the agents. Experi-

States Period (WSP) in Ancient China. By evaluating the simulation effectiveness,
we examine the advancements and limitations of cutting-edge AI systems’ abilities
in studying complex collective human behaviors such as international conflicts
under diverse settings. In these simulations, the emergent interactions among
agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that
lead to war. Our findings offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can
redefine how we approach conflict resolution and peacekeeping strategies. The
implications stretch beyond historical analysis, offering a blueprint for using AI to
understand human history and possibly prevent future international conflicts. Code

War and Peace (WarAgent): Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Simulation of World Wars,"Wenyue Hua, Lizhou Fan, Lingyao Li, Kai Mei, Jianchao Ji, Yingqiang Ge, Libby Hemphill, Yongfeng Zhang",2023.11.28,"Can we avoid wars at the crossroads of history? This question has been pursued by
individuals, scholars, policymakers, and organizations throughout human history.
In this research, we attempt to answer the question based on the recent advances
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose
WarAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent AI system, to simulate the participating
countries, their decisions, and the consequences, in historical international conflicts,
including the World War I (WWI), the World War II (WWII), and the Warring
