However, the translation of literarytexts remains a formidable challenge due to their complex language, figurative ex-pressions, and cultural nuances. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agentframework based on large language models (LLMs) for literary translation, im-plemented as a company called TRANSAGENTS, which mirrors traditional trans-lation publication process by leveraging the collective capabilities of multipleagents, to address the intricate demands of translating literary works. To evaluatethe effectiveness of our system, we propose two innovative evaluation strategies:Monolingual Human Preference (MHP) and Bilingual LLM Preference (BLP).MHP assesses translations from the perspective of monolingual readers of the tar-get language, while BLP uses advanced LLMs to compare translations directlywith the original texts. Empirical findings indicate that despite lower d-BLEUscores, translations from TRANSAGENTS are preferred by both human evalua-tors and LLMs over human-written references, particularly in genres requiringdomain-specific knowledge. We also highlight the strengths and limitations ofTRANSAGENTS through case studies and suggests directions for future research.","Monash University, University of Macau, Tencent AI Lab"

This study utilizes the intricateAvalon game as a testbed to explore LLMs’ potential in deceptive environments.Avalon, full of misinformation and requiring sophisticated logic, manifests as a“Game-of-Thoughts”. Inspired by the efficacy of humans’ recursive thinking andperspective-taking in the Avalon game, we introduce a novel framework, Recur-sive Contemplation (ReCon), to enhance LLMs’ ability to identify and counteractdeceptive information. ReCon combines formulation and refinement contempla-tion processes; formulation contemplation produces initial thoughts and speech,while refinement contemplation further polishes them.

Two common strategies have emerged: 1) reducing the input length, such as retrieving relevant chunks by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 2) expanding the context window limit of LLMs. However, both strategies have drawbacks: input reduction has no guarantee of covering the part with needed information, while window extension struggles with focusing on the pertinent information for solving the task. To mitigate these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel framework that harnesses multi-agent collaboration through natural language to enable information aggregation and context reasoning across various LLMs over long-context tasks. CoA consists of multiple worker agents who sequentially communicate to handle different segmented portions of the text, followed by a manager agent who synthesizes these contributions into a coherent final output. CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. We perform comprehensive evaluation of CoA on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion, demonstrating significant improvements by up to 10% over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs.","Penn State University, Google Cloud AI Research"

Two main difficulties are identified: 1) executing plans in an open-world environment (e.g., Minecraft) necessitates accurate and multi-step reasoning due to the long-term nature of tasks, and 2) as vanilla planners do not consider how easy the current agent can achieve a given sub-task when ordering parallel sub-goals within a complicated plan, the resulting plan could be inefficient or even infeasible. To this end, we propose ""Describe, Explain, Plan and Select"" (DEPS), an interactive planning approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs).

To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language.

Despite this, their capac-ities to coordinate within task-oriented social contexts are under-explored. Suchcapabilities are crucial if LLMs are to effectively mimic human-like social be-havior and produce meaningful results. To bridge this gap, we introduce collab-orative generative agents, endowing LLM-based Agents with consistent behaviorpatterns and task-solving abilities. We situate these agents in a simulated job fairenvironment as a case study to scrutinize their coordination skills. We proposea novel framework that equips collaborative generative agents with human-likereasoning abilities and specialized skills. Our evaluation demonstrates that theseagents show promising performance. However, we also uncover limitations thathinder their effectiveness in more complex coordination tasks.

Since its launch by OpenAI in February 2024, no other video generation models have paralleled {Sora}'s performance or its capacity to support a broad spectrum of video generation tasks. Additionally, there are only a few fully published video generation models, with the majority being closed-source. To address this gap, this paper proposes a new multi-agent framework Mora, which incorporates several advanced visual AI agents to replicate generalist video generation demonstrated by Sora. In particular, Mora can utilize multiple visual agents and successfully mimic Sora's video generation capabilities in various tasks, such as (1) text-to-video generation, (2) text-conditional image-to-video generation, (3) extend generated videos, (4) video-to-video editing, (5) connect videos and (6) simulate digital worlds. Our extensive experimental results show that Mora achieves performance that is proximate to that of Sora in various tasks. However, there exists an obvious performance gap between our work and Sora when assessed holistically. In summary, we hope this project can guide the future trajectory of video generation through collaborative AI agents.","Lehigh University, Microsoft Research"

Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose ReConcile, a multi-model multi-agent framework designed as a round table conference among diverse LLM agents. ReConcile enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt' that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly improves LLMs' reasoning -- both individually and as a team -- surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4% and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. ReConcile also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8% improvement on MATH.

Moreover, they areunable to extract details relevant to the question, instead providing generaldescriptions of the frame.
